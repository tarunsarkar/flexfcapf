\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my deep-felt gratitude to my advisor, Sébastien Auroux. I could successfully complete this work because of your continuous guidance and valuable suggestions at the right time. I must thank Prof. Dr. Holger Karl for giving me the opportunity to work on this topic and for valuable inputs at the difficult situation. I would also like to convey my thanks to the Computer Networks Group of Paderborn University for suggestions on different problems I faced during this work.

My biggest thanks go to my parents for bringing me into this beautiful world. I would not be in this place without your teachings, blessings and immeasurable love. You always believed in me and supported me in all situations in my life.

And finally, I must thank my dear girlfriend Pilar for being there with me always and for your continuous love. Without your help and support, I could not finish this work.
